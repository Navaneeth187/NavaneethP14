# Number Guessing Game â€“ C Program
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This C program is a fun number guessing game. The computer randomly picks a number,  
and the user must guess it. Helpful hints are provided ("Too High" / "Too Low") until the correct number is guessed.  
Great for practicing loops, conditionals, and random number generation in C.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# FEATURES
1. Random number generation  
2. Repeated guessing with hints  
3. Tracks number of attempts  
4. Option to play again  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# STEPS
1. Save the code as `guess_game.c`  
2. Compile it using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc guess_game.c -o guess_game`)  
3. Run the program (`./guess_game` or `guess_game.exe`)  
4. Try to guess the number chosen by the computer!

# CODE
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int main() {
    int number, guess, attempts;
    char playAgain;

    srand(time(0)); // Initialize random seed

    do {
        number = rand() % 100 + 1; // Random number between 1 and 100
        attempts = 0;

        printf("\nðŸŽ¯ Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!\n");
        printf("I have picked a number between 1 and 100.\n");
        printf("Can you guess it?\n");

        do {
            printf("Enter your guess: ");
            scanf("%d", &guess);
            attempts++;

            if (guess > number) {
                printf("ðŸ“‰ Too high! Try again.\n");
            } else if (guess < number) {
                printf("ðŸ“ˆ Too low! Try again.\n");
            } else {
                printf("âœ… Congratulations! You guessed it in %d attempts!\n", attempts);
            }
        } while (guess != number);

        printf("ðŸŽ® Do you want to play again? (Y/N): ");
        scanf(" %c", &playAgain);

    } while (playAgain == 'Y' || playAgain == 'y');

    printf("ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for playing! Goodbye.\n");

    return 0;
}

# Usage Tips
- You can increase the difficulty by changing the range (e.g., 1 to 500)  
- Add a high score tracker by storing minimum attempts  
- Great project for converting into a GUI or web-based game later
